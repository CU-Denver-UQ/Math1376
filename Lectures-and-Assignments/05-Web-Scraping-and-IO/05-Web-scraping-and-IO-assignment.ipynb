You may even want to download the notebook from the repo and experiment with it. \n",

    "Describe what the data represents. Discuss questions you want to answer (and then answer them of course). Basically, make this into a type of report/tutorial that you could hand to a classmate, present to a friend or family member, etc. Show off problems/limitations with the data, how to address these issues (or explain why these issues cannot be fixed), etc. In other words, show off your skills and have fun! At the end, save your dataset as a csv file and show how it can be loaded and analyzed from this file. \n",
