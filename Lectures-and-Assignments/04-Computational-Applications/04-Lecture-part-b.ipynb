    "Suppose $f(x)=5$ on $[0,1]$. From our previous example involving velocity and conceptualizing the integral of a real-valued function with a univariate input as the signed area between the curve and horizontal axis, we know that $\\int_{[0,1]} 5 = 5(1-0)=5$. So, this is what our MC estimate should be approximating.\n",

    "In fact, for any random sample of $x$-values between $[0,1]$, we will *always* get that the corresponding function values are *all* 5 because $f(x)$ is a constant 5 on this interval. So, what would the sample average be of these randomly sampled function values? Well, 5 of course! Whoa! The MC estimate is *exact* in this case. Great!\n",

    "What if $f(x)=5$ on $[0,2]$? So, all we have done is change the set from $[0,1]$ to $[0,2]$. We know the exact answer should now be $\\int_{[0,2]} 5 = 5(2-0)=10$. However, by the same reasoning, any random sample of $f(x)$ values will produce a sample average of $5$ not $10$. \n",

    "What if $f(x)=5$ on $[0,0.5]$? Again, the exact answer is $\\int_{[0,0.5]} 5 = 5(0.5-2)=2.5$, yet any sample average of $f(x)$ values will produce $5$ not $2.5$. \n",
