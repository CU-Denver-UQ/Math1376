    "Before we discuss how this happens, we address some terminology. What does *smooth* mean? For the purposes of this discussion, it means the function has as many *derivatives* as we require. What is a *derivative*? It is a concept from calculus, but here you can just think of it in very physical terms: the derivative of position as a function of time is velocity, the derivative of velocity as a function of time is acceleration, etc. (is there a physically meaningful derivative of acceleration? Yes! It is called the *jerk*, and I do not mean in the context \"This lying jerk said we didn't need to know calculus!\").\n",

Let $f(t)$ denote the first derivative of $h(t)$. Then, the solutions to $f(t)=0$ (i.e., the roots of $f(t)$) give the potential times of maximum/minimum heights. We can then evaluate $h$ at all the roots of $f$ to determine what the heights are at these *critical* values. \n",

    "- Suppose a function $I(t)$ describes the number of people infected with a virus at any given time $t$. Knowing when the infected number \"spikes\" (produces a value that is maximum relative to other nearby values in time) is useful for guiding public healthy policy and direction of resources. Like the example above, this requires knowing when the derivative of $I(t)$ is zero. \n",
