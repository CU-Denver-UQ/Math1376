    "\n",
    "[Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function) are used in many applications and disciplines such as non-parametric density estimation in statistics, approximations of function responses on unstructured data sets, and defining some types of artificial neural networks.\n",
    "In other words, they are [kind of a big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8OxKx6zKkQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the idea/purpose/features of an RBF?\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarize the <font size=5>big picture</font>  idea behind why RBFs are used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have some information about \"what happens\" at a point in space, denoted by $\\mathbf{c}$, and we want to use this information to \"infer what may happen\" at a point $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the big picture idea, we expect RBFs to exhibit the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\mathbf{x}$ is \"close\" to $\\mathbf{c}$, then the knowledge we have about what happens at $\\mathbf{c}$ should play a big role in informing what we think may happen at $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\mathbf{x}$ is \"far away\" from $\\mathbf{c}$, then perhaps we should reduce how much we rely on the knowledge we have at $\\mathbf{c}$ to inform us about what may happen at $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we go from concept to practice? \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things have to be made more concrete: what functions exhibit such desirable features, what do we mean by \"close\" and \"far away\", and how do we measure distance anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a bit more mathematically precise, we formalize our notation. \n",
    "- Let $\\phi$ denote an RBF that maps a \"distance\" $r\\in[0,\\infty)$ into $\\mathbf{R}$ such that $\\phi(0)$ is the maximum and $\\phi(r_1)>\\phi(r_2)$ whenever $0\\leq r_1<r_2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The image below of a Gaussian RBF illustrates these concepts where we see that if $r=0$, this would mean the point $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}$ and the RBF is \"maximized\" and the RBF decreases as $r$ increases (when $\\mathbf{x}$ moves away from $\\mathbf{c}$ either to the left or right).\n",

    "\n",
    "- The [taxicab distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) is useful when the distance measured in moving from one point to another is best described by moving along a \"grid of roads\". This is closely related to how we actually think of the \"real distance\" of two points on a map when the \"straight line path\" is impossible to traverse. This is sometimes called the 1-norm distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance) is useful when the distance measured in moving from one point to another is best described by the longest distance we have to travel in any one direction. This is sometimes called the $\\infty$-norm distance. "
